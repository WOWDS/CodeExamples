CV example of my coding

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Here are some examples of coding for propsective clients to view, containing php, html and css files. This is part of a CMS I've developed.

I've integrated TinyMCE and MoxieManager and have used this for the login (https://github.com/panique/php-login-advanced/), so all the files in the "login-lib" are not mine, but I have edited the forms slightly.
